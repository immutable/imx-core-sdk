**The Core TypeScript SDK Interface is unstable and hasn't hit v1.0 yet.** Its public interface is unstable, and there are breaking changes scheduled to happen in the coming weeks to its interface. Some of the upcoming changes include: 
- The `config` object is getting a revamp.
- The `/src/utils/stark` signing methods will end up private.
- The `/src/utils/crypto` methods will end up private.
- Many API endpoints require a type to be defined. E.g., `TokenType.ETH`, `TokenType.ERC20`. We are doing away with these constants since they're superfluous and can be inferred from the API being called and the parameters passed in.
- The workflow methods' signatures are changing to accommodate the new wallet SDK due to be released soon. E.g. the method
`isRegisteredOnchain(signer: Signer, starkWallet: StarkWallet)` will be changed on v0.7 to `isRegisteredOnchain(walletConnection: WalletConnection)` to be compatible with the Wallets SDK's interface.

# Immutable Core SDK

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@imtbl%2Fcore-sdk.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@imtbl/core-sdk) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/219466ee5269620167e5/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/62848fd8d4420d01b6002210/maintainability)

The Immutable Core SDK provides convenient access to Immutable's APIs and smart contracts to help projects build better web3 games and marketplaces.

Currently, our SDK supports interactions with our application-specific rollup based on StarkWare's StarkEx. In future, we'll be adding StarkNet support across our platform.

## Documentation

See the [developer guides](https://docs.x.immutable.com) for information on building on Immutable X.

## Usage

### Configuration

A configuration object is required to be passed into Core SDK requests. This can be obtained by using the `getConfig` function available within the Core SDK. You are required to provide the correct contract addresses, Chain ID, and api base path of the network you wish to use. The Immutable X platform currently supports `ropsten` for testing and `mainnet` for production.

| Network   | Chain ID | API Base Path                       | Core Contract Address                        | Registration Contract Address                |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ropsten` | 3        | https://api.ropsten.x.immutable.com | `0x4527BE8f31E2ebFbEF4fCADDb5a17447B27d2aef` | `0x6C21EC8DE44AE44D0992ec3e2d9f1aBb6207D864` |
| `mainnet` | 1        | https://api.x.immutable.com         | `0x5FDCCA53617f4d2b9134B29090C87D01058e27e9` | `0x72a06bf2a1CE5e39cBA06c0CAb824960B587d64c` |


```ts
import { AlchemyProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers';
import { getConfig } from '@imtbl/core-sdk';

const ethNetwork = 'ropsten'; // or mainnet;

// Use the helper function to get the config
const config = getConfig({
  coreContractAddress: '0x4527BE8f31E2ebFbEF4fCADDb5a17447B27d2aef',
  registrationContractAddress: '0x6C21EC8DE44AE44D0992ec3e2d9f1aBb6207D864',
  chainID: 3,
  basePath:  'https://api.ropsten.x.immutable.com',
  headers: { 'x-api-custom-header': '...' } // headers are optional unless specified otherwise
});

// Setup a provider and a signer
const privateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY;
const provider = new AlchemyProvider(ethNetwork, YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY);
const signer = new Wallet(privateKey).connect(provider);
```

#### WalletConnection

WalletConnection is a top level connector which contains all the required resources (eg. L1 and L2 signers) to enable usage of the Core SDK workflows.

```ts
import { AlchemyProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers';
import { Wallet } from '@ethersproject/wallet';
import { WalletConnection, generateStarkWallet, BaseSigner } from '@imtbl/core-sdk';

// Generate your own WalletConnection
const generateWalletConnection = async (provider: AlchemyProvider) : Promise<WalletConnection> => {
  // L1 credentials
  const l1Signer = Wallet.createRandom().connect(provider);

  // L2 credentials
  const starkWallet = await generateStarkWallet(l1Signer);
  const l2Signer = new BaseSigner(starkWallet.starkKeyPair);

  return {
    l1Signer,
    l2Signer,
  };
};
```

### Standard API Requests

The Core SDK includes classes that interact with the Immutable X APIs.

```ts
// Standard API request example usage
import { getConfig, AssetsApi } from '@imtbl/core-sdk';

const getYourAsset = async (tokenAddress: string, tokenId: string) => {
  const config = getConfig({
    coreContractAddress: '0x4527BE8f31E2ebFbEF4fCADDb5a17447B27d2aef',
    registrationContractAddress: '0x6C21EC8DE44AE44D0992ec3e2d9f1aBb6207D864',
    chainID: 3,
    basePath:  'https://api.ropsten.x.immutable.com',
  });
  const assetsApi = new AssetsApi(config.apiConfiguration);

  const response = await assetsApi.getAsset({
    tokenAddress,
    tokenId,
  });

  return response;
};
```

View the [OpenAPI spec](openapi.json) for a full list of API requests available in the Core SDK.

### Authorised project owner requests

Some methods require authorisation by the project owner, which consists of a Unix epoch timestamp signed with your ETH key and included in the request header.

On project and collection methods that require authorisation, this signed timestamp string can typically be passed as the `iMXSignature` and `iMXTimestamp` parameters.

```ts
// Example method to generate authorisation headers
const getProjectOwnerAuthorisationHeaders = async (signer: Signer) => {
  const timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000).toString();
  const signature = await signRaw(timestamp, signer);

  return {
    timestamp,
    signature,
  };
};

// Using generated authorisation headers
const createProject = async (
  name: string,
  company_name: string,
  contact_email: string,
) => {
  const api = new ProjectsApi(this.config.api);
  const { timestamp, signature } = getProjectOwnerAuthorisationHeaders(signer);

  return await api.createProject({
    createProjectRequest: {
      name,
      company_name,
      contact_email,
    },
    iMXSignature: signature,
    iMXTimestamp: timestamp,
  });
};
```

The following methods require project owner authorisation:

**Projects**

- createProject
- getProject
- getProjects

**Collections**

- createCollection
- updateCollection

**Metadata**

- addMetadataSchemaToCollection
- updateMetadataSchemaByName

### Contract Requests

Immutable X is built as a ZK-rollup in partnership with StarkWare. We chose the ZK-rollups because it is the only solution capable of scale without compromise. This means whenever you mint or trade an NFT on Immutable X, you pay zero gas, and the validity of all transactions are directly enforced by Ethereum’s security using zero-knowledge proofs -- the first “layer 2” for NFTs on Ethereum.

The Core SDK provides interfaces for all smart contracts required to interact with the Immutable X platform.

[See all smart contract available in the Core SDK](#smart-contract-autogeneration)

```ts
import { Core__factory } from '@imtbl/core-sdk';

// Get instance of core contract
const contract = Core__factory.connect(config.coreContractAddress, signer);

// Obtain necessary parameters...

// Populate and send transaction
const populatedTransaction = await contract.populateTransaction.depositNft(
  starkPublicKey,
  assetType,
  vaultId,
  tokenId,
);

const transactionResponse = await signer.sendTransaction(populatedTransaction);
```

### Workflows

A workflow is a combination of API and contract calls required for more complicated functionality.

```ts
// User registration workflow example
import { AlchemyProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers';
import { Wallet } from '@ethersproject/wallet';
import { 
  Workflows, 
  BaseSigner, 
  getConfig, 
  generateStarkWallet,
} from '@imtbl/core-sdk';

const ethNetwork = 'ropsten';

// Sets up the provider
const alchemyApiKey = 'UPDATE WITH THE ALCHEMY API KEY HERE';
const alchemyProvider = new AlchemyProvider(ethNetwork, alchemyApiKey);

// Sets up the L1Signer
const privateKey = 'UPDATE WITH THE PRIVATE KEY HERE';
const l1Wallet = new Wallet(privateKey);
const l1Signer = l1Wallet.connect(alchemyProvider);

// Sets up the L2Signer
const l2Wallet = await generateStarkWallet(l1Signer);
const l2Signer = new BaseSigner(l2Wallet.starkKeyPair);

// Sets up the Core SDK workflows
const coreSdkConfig = getConfig({
  coreContractAddress: '0x4527BE8f31E2ebFbEF4fCADDb5a17447B27d2aef',
  registrationContractAddress: '0x6C21EC8DE44AE44D0992ec3e2d9f1aBb6207D864',
  chainID: 3,
  basePath:  'https://api.ropsten.x.immutable.com',
});
const coreSdkWorkflows = new Workflows(coreSdkConfig);

// Registers the user
const walletConnection = { l1Signer, l2Signer };
await coreSdkWorkflows.registerOffchain(walletConnection);
```

The workflow can be found in the [workflows directory](src/workflows/).

## Autogenerated Code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagically generated.

### API Autogenerated Code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.
The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo.

### Smart contract autogeneration

The Immutable solidity contracts can be found under `contracts` folder. Contract bindings in typescript is generated using [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/guides/compile-contracts.html).

#### Core

The Core contract is Immutable's main interface with the Ethereum blockchain, based on [StarkEx](https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4).

[View contract](contracts/Core.sol)

#### Registration

The Registration contract is a proxy smart contract for the Core contract that combines transactions related to onchain registration, deposits and withdrawals. When a user who is not registered onchain attempts to perform a deposit or a withdrawal, the Registration combines requests to the Core contract in order to register the user first. - users who are not registered onchain are not able to perform a deposit or withdrawal.

For example, instead of making subsequent transaction requests to the Core contract, i.e. `registerUser` and `depositNft`, a single transaction request can be made to the proxy Registration contract - `registerAndWithdrawNft`.

[View contract](contracts/Registration.sol)

#### IERC20

Standard interface for interacting with ERC20 contracts, taken from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20).

#### IERC721

Standard interface for interacting with ERC721 contracts, taken from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721).

## Webpack 5

Webpack 5 no longer uses NodeJS polyfills, such as `crypto`, which in turn breaks the Core SDK resulting in errors such as
`Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto'`.

To fix this, you can use a webpack polyfill plugin like [node-polyfill-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-polyfill-webpack-plugin), or if you're using `create-react-app` in your project which hides the Webpack config, [this blog post](https://alchemy.com/blog/how-to-polyfill-node-core-modules-in-webpack-5) explains how to add polyfills to your CRA project.
