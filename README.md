# Immutable Core SDK

The Immutable Core SDK provides convenient access to the Immutable API's and Ethereum contract methods for applications written on the Immutable X platform.

## Documentation

See the [developer guides](https://docs.x.immutable.com/docs) for information on building on Immutable X.

See the [API reference documentation](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference) for more information on our API's.

## Installation

Install the package with:

```sh
npm install @imtbl/core-sdk --save
# or
yarn add @imtbl/core-sdk
```

## Usage

### Configuration

A configuration object is required to be passed into Core SDK requests. This can be obtained by using the `getConfig` function available within the Core SDK. You are required to select the Ethereum network. The Immutable X platform currently supports `ropsten` for testing and `mainnet` for production.

```ts
import { AlchemyProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers';
import { getConfig } from '@imtbl/core-sdk';

const ethNetwork = 'ropsten' // or mainnet;

/**
 * use the helper function to get the config
 */
const config = getConfig(ethNetwork);

// setup a provider and signer
const privateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY;
const provider = new AlchemyProvider(ethNetwork, YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY);
const signer = new Wallet(privateKey).connect(provider);
```

### Standard API Requests

The Core SDK includes classes that interact with the Immutable X APIs.

```ts
// standard API request example usage  
import { getConfig, AssetsApi } from "@imtbl/core-sdk";

const getYourAsset = await (tokenAddress: string, tokenId: string) => {
  const config = getConfig("ropsten");
  const assetsApi = new AssetsApi(config.api);

  const response = await assetsApi.getAsset({
    tokenAddress,
    tokenId,
  });

  return response;
};
```

View the [OpenAPI spec](openapi.json) for a full list of API requests available in the Core SDK.

### Authenticated API Requests

Some methods require authorisation, which is a Unix epoch timestamp signed with your ETH key and included in the request header.

On project and collection methods that require authorsation, this signed timestamp string can typically be passed as the `iMXSignature` parameter.

```ts
// example method to generate a signed Unix timestamp
const getAuthenticationHeader = async () => {
  const timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000).toString();
  const signature = await signRaw(timestamp, signer);
  return signature;
};
```

The following methods require authorisation:

**Projects**
- createProject
- getProject
- getProjects

**Collections**
- createCollection
- updateCollection

**Metadata**
- addMetadataSchemaToCollection
- updateMetadataSchemaByName

### L1 Signing

[TODO]

### Contract Requests

[TODO] add description about how imx is built on starkex

[TODO] add example of a singular contract call

### Workflows

A workflow is a combination of API and contract calls required for more complicated functionality.

```ts
/**
 * User registration workflow example
 */
import { AlchemyProvider } from "@ethersproject/providers";
import { Wallet } from "@ethersproject/wallet";
import { getConfig, Workflows } from "@imtbl/core-sdk";

const alchemyApiKey = YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY;
const ethNetwork = "ropsten";

// setup provider and signer 
const provider = new AlchemyProvider(ethNetwork, alchemyApiKey);
const signer = new Wallet(privateKey).connect(provider);

// configure Core SDK Workflow class
const config = getConfig(ethNetwork);
const workflows = new Workflows(config);

const registerUser = async () => {
  const response = await workflows.registerOffchain(signer);
  console.log(response);
};
```

The workflow can be found in the [workflows directory](src/workflows/).

### Available Workflows

The current workflow methods exposed from the `Workflow` class.

- batchNftTranser
- burn
- deposit
- depositERC20
- depositERC721
- depositEth
- getBurn
- isRegisteredOnchain
- mint
- registerOffchain
- transfer

## Autogenerated Code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagiaclly generated.

### API Autogenerated Code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.
The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo.

### Smart contract autogeneration

[TODO - Allan?]

## Changelog Management

This repository is using release-it to manage the CHANGELOG.md

The following headings should be used as appropriate

- Added
- Changed
- Deprecated
- Removed
- Fixed

What follows is an example with all the change headings, for real world use only use headings when appropriate.
This goes at the top of the CHANGELOG.md above the most recent release.

```markdown
...

## [Unreleased]

### Added

for new features.

### Changed

for changes in existing functionality.

### Deprecated

for soon-to-be removed features.

### Removed

for now removed features.

### Fixed

for any bug fixes.

...
```

The package.json will hold the value of the previous release

```json
...
"version": "0.3.0",
...
```

When PR is ready for review, the submitter should run:

`yarn release [patch | major | minor]`

- Choose release type (patch|minor|major)
- Choose yes to use changelog and package.json
- Add a tag if required - this step can be skipped by replying `no`
- Push to remote by using yes
